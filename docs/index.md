# Nextflow for the Life Sciences 2025

This workshop will provide you with the foundational knowledge required to build Nextflow workflows. The content is broken up into 2 parts. In the first part we will cover the basic principles for developing Nextflow pipelines. In the second part we will step through building our own Nextflow workflow. See the [event description](https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/nextflow-life-sciences) and [workshop schedule](#workshop-schedule) for learning outcomes and lesson plan, respectively.

## Prerequisites

This is an intermediate-advanced workshop for people developing reproducible bioinformatics workflows. It assumes some experience with the following:

* Experience working on the command line/Linux environment.
* Experience with basic scripting (e.g. Bash).

In addition, experience with other reproducible workflow tools (e.g. CWL, WDL, or Snakemake) will be very useful, although not at all required for this workshop.

## Set up requirements

Please complete the [Setup](setup.md) instruction before the workshop. If you have any trouble, please get in contact with us ASAP via Slack.

## Code of Conduct
In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours at all our events and on our platforms:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
