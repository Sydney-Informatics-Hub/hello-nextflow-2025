## Nextflow tips and tricks

Nextflow has some useful features for executing pipelines and querying metadata and history. Here are some resources to help you get started.

### Query specific pipeline executions

The [Nextflow log](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#log) command is useful for querying execution metadata and history. You can filter your queries and output specific fields in the printed log.

```default
nextflow log <run_name> -help
```

### Execute Nextflow in the background

The [`-bg`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html?highlight=bg#execution-as-a-background-job) options allows you to run your pipeline in the background and continue using your terminal. It is similar to `nohup`. You can redirect all standard output to a log file.

```default
nextflow run <workflow_repo/main.nf> -bg > workshop_tip.log
```

### Capture a Nextflow pipeline's configuration

The [Nextflow config](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#config) command prints the resolved pipeline configuration. It is especially useful for printing all resolved parameters and profiles Nextflow will use to run a pipeline.

```default
nextflow config <workflow_repo> -help
```

### Clean Nextflow cache and work directories

The [Nextflow clean](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#clean) command will remove files from previous executions stored in the `.nextflow` cache and `work` directories. The `-dry-run` option allows you to preview which files will be deleted.

```default
nextflow clean <workflow_repo> -help
```

### Change default Nextflow cache strategy
Workflow execution is [sometimes not resumed as expected](https://training.nextflow.io/basic_training/cache_and_resume/#resume-troubleshootingl). The [default behaviour of Nextflow cache keys](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#cache) is to index the input files meta-data information. Reducing the cache stringency to `lenient` means the files cache keys are based only on filesize and path, and can help to avoid unexpectedly re-running certain processes when `-resume` is in use.

To apply lenient cache strategy to all of your runs, you could add to a custom configuration file:

```default
process {
    cache = 'lenient'
}
```

You can specify different cache stategies for different processes by using `withName` or `withLabel`. You can specify a particular cache strategy be applied to certain `profiles` within your institutional config, or to apply to all profiles described within that config by placing the above `process` code block outside the `profiles` scope.

### Access private GitHub repositories

To interact with private repositories on GitHub, you can provide Nextflow with [access to GitHub](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/sharing.html#github-credentials) by specifying your GitHub user name and a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in the [`scm` configuration file](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/sharing.html#scm-configuration-file) inside your specified `.nextflow/` directory:

```default
providers {

  github {
    user = 'georgiesamaha'
    password = 'my-personal-access-token'
  }

}
```
