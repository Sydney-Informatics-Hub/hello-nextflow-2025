# Writing your first pipeline

!!! info "Learning objectives"

    1. Write your first Nextflow pipeline
    2. Understand the main components of a Nextflow script
    3. Understand the components of a Nextflow process

Workflow languages are better than Bash scripts because they handle errors and run tasks in parallel more easily, which is important for complex jobs. They also have clearer structure, making it easier to maintain and work on with others.

Here, you're going learn more about the Nextflow language and take your first steps making **your first pipeline** with Nextflow.

## Understanding the `process` and `workflow` scopes

Nextflow pipelines are written inside `.nf` files. They consist of a combination of two main components: **processes** and the **workflow** itself. Each process describes a single step of the pipeline, including its inputs and expected outputs, as well as the code to run it. The workflow then defines the logic that puts all of the processes together.

```groovy
process < name > {
  [ directives ]

  input:
    < process inputs >

  output:
    < process outputs >

  script:
  """
  <script to be executed>
  """
}

workflow {
    < processes to be executed >
}
```

A process definition starts with the keyword `process`, followed by a process name, and finally the process body delimited by curly braces. The process body must contain a `script` block which represents the command or, more generally, a script that is executed by it.

A process may contain any of the following definition blocks. The ones we will be focusing on this workshop are presented in bold: **`directives`**, **`input`**, **`output`**, `stub`, `when` clauses, and of course, **`script`**.

A workflow is a composition of processes and dataflow logic.

The workflow definition starts with the keyword `workflow`, followed by an optional name, and finally the workflow body delimited by curly braces.

!!! info "Tip"

    The `process` and `workflow` definitions are analogous to functions in R or
    Python languages. You first have to define a function (the `process`) that
    contains the instructions of what to do. In order to do the action, the
    function needs to be called (in the `workflow`).

Let's review the structure of `hello-world.nf`, a toy example you will be developing and executing in Part 1.

```groovy title="hello-world.nf" linenums="1"
process SAYHELLO {

    output:
    path 'output.txt'

    script:
    """
    echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt
    """
}

workflow {
    SAYHELLO()
}
```

The first piece of code (lines 1-11) describes a **process** called `SAYHELLO` with two definition blocks:

- **output**: defines that the process will output a file called `output.txt`. It also contains the `path` qualifier. We will review this in the next section.
- **script**: the `echo 'Hello World!'` command redirects to a file called `output.txt`

The second block of code (12-14) lines describes the **workflow** itself, which consists of one call to the `SAYHELLO` process.

We will start building the `hello-world.nf` script, piece-by-piece, so you can get a feel
for the high-level steps to approach building a workflow and why certain things
are required.

!!! info "Tip"

    We can use the `code` command in the terminal to view files in a VSCode tab. If it doesn't exist, it will create that file. The following command will create a new file called `hello-world.nf`:
    ```bash
    code hello-world.nf
    ```

!!! question "Exercises"

    1. Create a new file `hello-world.nf`.

    2. In the new file, define an empty `process` and call it `SAYHELLO`.
    
    ??? "Solution"
        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf"
        process SAYHELLO {
        
        }
        ```

    <ol start="3">
        <li>Add the `script` definition that writes 'Hello World!' to a file called `output.txt`.</li>
    </ol>

    ??? "Solution"
        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" hl_lines="3-6"
        process SAYHELLO {
        
            script:
            """
            echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt
            """
        }
        ```

To complete this process, we need to add an `output` definition.

## Capturing process outputs 

In the previous section, you have defined the `script` - what the `SAYHELLO` process should do.
We also need to tell Nextflow to expect this output file - otherwise, it will ignore it!

We declare outputs using the `output` definition block. Typically this will require
both an **output qualifier** and an **output name**:

```groovy
output:
<output qualifier> <output name>
```

Common output qualifiers include `val` and `path`:

- `val`: Emit the variable with the specified name
    - For example, `val 'Hello World!'`
- `path`: Emit a file produced by the process with the specified name
    - For example, `path 'output.txt'`

See the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#outputs)
for a full list of output qualifiers.

!!! warning

    If you set the wrong qualifier, the pipeline will likely throw errors.

The **output name** is a name given to the output variable. If a specific file
is being produced it can be named in single quotes.

!!!question "Exercise"

    In your `SAYHELLO` process, add an `output` block that captures 'output.txt'.
    Since it is a file being emitted by the process, the `path` qualifier must be
    used.

    ??? "Solution"
        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" hl_lines="3-5"
        process SAYHELLO {

            output:
            path 'output.txt'
        
            script:
            """
            echo 'Hello World!' > output.txt
            """
        }
        ```

## Commenting your code

It is worthwhile to **comment** your code so we, and others, can easily understand what the code is doing (you will thank yourself later).

In Nextflow, a single line comment can be added by prepending it with two forward slash (`//`):

```groovy
// This is my comment
```

Similarly, multi-line comments can be added using the following format:

```groovy
/*
 * Use echo to print 'Hello World!' to standard out
 */
```

As a developer you can to choose how and where to comment your code.

!!!question "Exercise"

    Add a comment to the pipeline to describe what the **process** block is doing

    ??? "Solution"

        The solution may look something like this:

        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" hl_lines="1-3"
        /*
         * Use echo to print 'Hello World!' to a text file
         */
        process SAYHELLO {
        <truncated>
        ```

        Or this:

        ```groovy title="hello-world.nf" hl_lines="1"
        // Use echo to print 'Hello World!' to a text file
        process SAYHELLO {
        <truncated>
        ```

        As a developer, you get to choose!

**Yay! You have just written your first pipeline!**

In the next step, we will run the pipeline and inspect the outputs of
our workflow.

!!! abstract "Summary"

    In this step you have learned:

    1. How to create a simple Nextflow pipeline
    2. The key components that form a Nextflow script `process` and `workflow`
    3. How to define a process with `script` and `output` blocks
    4. How to comment your code

## Executing `hello-world.nf`

The **`nextflow run`** command is used to execute Nextflow pipelines:

```bash
nextflow run <pipeline.nf>
```

When a pipeline is stored locally you need to supply the path to the `.nf` script. Let's run the script we just created - remember to save the file first!

!!!question "Exercise"

    Use the `nextflow run` command to execute `hello-world.nf`

    ???Solution

        ```bash
        nextflow run hello-world.nf
        ```

**Yay! You have just run your first pipeline!**

Your console should look something like this:

```console linenums="1"
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 23.10.1
Launching `hello-world.nf` [mighty_murdock] DSL2 - revision: 80e92a677c
executor >  local (1)
[4e/6ba912] process > SAYHELLO [100%] 1 of 1 âœ”
Hello World!
```

**What does each line mean?**

1. The version of Nextflow that was executed
2. The script and version names
3. The executor used (in the above case: local)
4. The first process is executed once, which means there is one task. The line starts with a unique hexadecimal value, and ends with the task completion information
5. The result string from stdout is printed

## Understanding the task directories

When a Nextflow pipeline is executed, a `work` directory is created. Processes are executed in isolated **task** directories. Each task uses a unique directory based on its [hash](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cache-and-resume.html#task-hash) (e.g., `4e/6ba912`) within the work directory.

When a task is created, Nextflow stages the task input files, script, and other helper files into the task directory. The task writes any output files to this directory during its execution, and Nextflow uses these output files for downstream tasks and/or publishing.

These directories do not share a writable state, and any required files or information must be passed through channels (this will be important later).

!!!note

    You can execute `tree work` to view the work directory structure.

!!! warning

    The work directory might not have the same hash as the one shown above.

A series of files **log** files and any outputs are created by each task in the work directory:

- **`.command.begin`**: Metadata related to the beginning of the execution of the process task
- **`.command.err`**: Error messages (stderr) emitted by the process task
- **`.command.log`**: Complete log output emitted by the process task
- **`.command.out`**: Regular output (`stdout`) by the process task
- **`.command.sh`**: The command that was run by the process task call
- **`.exitcode`**: The exit code resulting from the command

These files are created by Nextflow to manage the execution of your pipeline. While these file are not required now, you may need to interrogate them to troubleshoot issues later.

!!!question "Exercise"

    Browse the `work` directory and view the `.command.sh` file

    ??? "Solution"

        _Note: The hash may be different to the example shown below._

        ```bash
        cat work/4e/6ba9138vhsbcbsc83bcka/.command.sh
        ```
