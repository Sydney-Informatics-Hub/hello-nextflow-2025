# Productionising our workflow

!!! note "Learning objectives"  

    1. Configure Nextflow workflows to run on multiple samples
    2. Enable and interpret Nextflow's inbuilt reports 
    3. Implement the `tag` directive to label tasks for better tracking and profiling
    4. Configure a Nextflow workflow to use multiple CPUs for a process 

Now that we have a working pipeline on a single-sample, we will update it 
to take multiple samples and introduce Nextflow concepts that not only help with understanding and profiling the pipeline but also set the stage for productionising it. 

We will focus on making the workflow scalable, robust, and efficient for real-world data processing. Key productionisation practices include: 

- Automating tasks
- Handling errors gracefully
- Optimising resource usage
- Ensuring reproducibility. 

These steps ensure that the pipeline can be reliably used in more complex scenarios, like when processing multiple samples in parallel. 

## Labeling tasks with the `tag` directive

The [tag](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#tag) process
directive allows you to add a custom label, or tag, to each task that gets
executed. It is useful for identifying what is being run when the workflow
is being executed in a bit more detail. It is especially helpful showing you 
what is being run when we run multiple samples, and for profiling later.

Add the following `tag` directives to your existing `FASTQC` and
`QUANTIFICATION` processes. 

For `FASTQC`:

```groovy title="main.nf" hl_lines="2"
process FASTQC {
    tag "fastqc on ${sample_id}"
    container "quay.io/biocontainers/fastqc:0.12.1--hdfd78af_0"
    publishDir "results", mode: 'copy'

```

And for `QUANTIFICATION`:  

```groovy title="main.nf" hl_lines="2"
process QUANTIFICATION {
    tag "salmon on ${sample_id}"
    container "quay.io/biocontainers/salmon:1.10.1--h7e5ed60_0"
    publishDir "results", mode: 'copy'

```

The tags we just added indicates what program is being run (`fastqc` or 
`salmon`), and on which sample (`${sample_id}`) it is being run on. 

Run the pipeline with the updated tags:  

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -resume
```

The output should look similar to:  

```console title="Output"
Launching `main.nf` [distraught_bell] DSL2 - revision: dcb06191e7

executor >  local (5)
[aa/3b8821] INDEX                           | 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
[c2/baa069] FASTQC (fastqc on gut)          | 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
[ad/e49b20] QUANTIFICATION (salmon on gut)  | 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
[a3/1f885c] MULTIQC                         | 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
```

No new tasks were run, but `FASTQC` and `QUANTIFICATION` processes now have
labels appended in the execution output.  

## Using a samplesheet with multiple samples  

Recall that the samplesheet is used to control which files/data are analysed by
the workflow. Inspect `data/samplesheet_full.csv`.  

```console linenums="1" title="samplesheet_full.csv"
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
gut,data/ggal/gut_1.fq,data/ggal/gut_2.fq
liver,data/ggal/liver_1.fq,data/ggal/liver_2.fq
lung,data/ggal/lung_1.fq,data/ggal/lung_2.fq
```

Compared to the samplesheet we have been using `data/samplesheet.csv`, this one
contains two additional lines for the `liver` and `lung` paired reads.

Next we will run the workflow with all three samples by overwriting the default 
input for `reads` with `data/samplesheet_full.csv` using the double hyphen 
approach `--reads` in the run command.

Run the workflow:  

```bash
nextflow run main.nf -resume --reads data/samplesheet_full.csv
```

Your output should look similar to:  

```console title="Output"
Launching `main.nf` [distraught_bell] DSL2 - revision: dcb06191e7

executor >  local (5)
[de/fef8c4] INDEX                           | 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
[4e/b4c797] FASTQC (fastqc on liver)        | 3 of 3, cached: 1 ✔
[36/93c8b4] QUANTIFICATION (salmon on lung) | 3 of 3, cached: 1 ✔
[e7/5d91ea] MULTIQC                         | 1 of 1 ✔

```

There are two new tasks run for `FASTQC` and `QUANTIFICATION`. Our newly added
tags indicate which samples they were run on - either `lung` or `liver` reads!

!!! example "Advanced Exercise"

    1. Update the workflow scope to inspect the output of the `reads_in` channel (i.e. with `.view()`)
    2. Run the workflow with `samplesheet_full.csv`

    What has changed with what the `reads_in` channel is emitting?

    ??? note "Solution"

        Viewing `reads_in`: 

        ```groovy title="main.nf" hl_lines="6"
            // Define the fastqc input channel
            reads_in = Channel.fromPath(params.reads)
                .splitCsv(header: true)
                .map { row -> [row.sample, file(row.fastq_1), file(row.fastq_2)] }

            reads_in.view()

            // Run the fastqc step with the reads_in channel
            FASTQC(reads_in)
        ```

        Run the workflow:  
        
        ```bash
        nextflow run main.nf -resume --reads data/samplesheet_full.csv
        ```
        
        Your output should look something like:  
        
        ```console title="Output"
        
        executor >  local (5)
        [de/fef8c4] INDEX                           | 1 of 1, cached: 1 ✔
        [4e/b4c797] FASTQC (fastqc on liver)        | 3 of 3, cached: 3 ✔
        [36/93c8b4] QUANTIFICATION (salmon on lung) | 3 of 3, cached: 3 ✔
        [e7/5d91ea] MULTIQC                         | 1 of 1 ✔
        [gut, .../data/ggal/gut_1.fq, .../data/ggal/gut_2.fq]
        [liver, .../data/ggal/liver_1.fq, .../data/ggal/liver_2.fq]
        [lung, .../data/ggal/lung_1.fq, .../data/ggal/lung_2.fq]
        ```  

        There are now a total of three tuples emitted separately for each sample. 
        When passed into `FASTQC` and `QUANTIFICATION`, each tuple is processed
        separately in independent tasks.

        Remove `reads_in.view()` before proceeding.

## An introduction to configuration  

In this section, we will explore how Nextflow workflows can be configured
to utilise the computational resources available. Whilst there are many ways
to configure Nextflow workflows (especially on HPC clusters), we will focus on
increasing the number of CPUs used to speed up tasks.  

Some bioinformatics tool, like FastQC, support multithreading to speed up
analyses. From the `fastqc --help` command, you'll notice the following option:

```console title="Output"
-t --threads    Specifies the number of files which can be processed    
                simultaneously.
```

This means we can configure the number of threads (or CPUs) that FastQC uses
to process multiple files in parallel to speed up the analysis. In Nextflow,
we control this through the 
[`cpus`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#cpus) directive.

Recall that our `FASTQC` takes as input the `reads_in` channel which emits two
`.fastq` files. We will configure the process to use 2 CPUs so each file gets
run on 1 CPU each (the maximum CPUs fastqc will use per file), simulataneously.

In your `main.nf` script, update the `script` definition in the `FASTQC` process
to add the multithreading option:  

```groovy title="main.nf" hl_lines="4"
    script:
    """
    mkdir fastqc_${sample_id}_logs
    fastqc --outdir "fastqc_${sample_id}_logs" -f fastq $reads_1 $reads_2 -t $task.cpus
    """
```

- The **`task.cpus`** variable is automatically populated with the number of 
CPUs allocated to the task based on the Nextflow configuration. By default this
is 1.  

Next, we need to update our `nextflow.config` file to configure the number of
CPUs to be used. To allow each FastQC process to use 2 CPUs, update the
config file as follows:  

```groovy title="nextflow.config" hl_lines="1"
process.cpus = 2
docker.enabled = true
```

The `-t $task.cpus` argument will populate as `-t 2` when we run the workflow next.
Before we do, we will explore Nextflow's built-in reporting system to assess resource usage.

## Inspecting workflow performance  

When running workflows, it is helpful to understand how each part of your
workflow is using resources like CPUs, memory, and the time taken to complete.
Nextflow can generate text-based and visual reports that give you clear picture
of how your workflow ran and identify areas for improvement.  

We will explore some of Nextflow's built-it in tools that can show these
important details of how tasks ran.

To enable these reports, add the following to your `nextflow.config` file:

```groovy title="nextflow.config" hl_lines="4-8"
process.cpus = 2
docker.enabled = true

// enable reporting
dag.enabled = true
report.enabled = true
timeline.enabled = true
trace.enabled = true
```

Run the workflow. To assess the resource usage all processes need to be run
again so `-resume` should not be used. (If we resume now, it will still
appear as a cached run, with limited information).  

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --reads "data/samplesheet_full.csv"
```

Inspect your project directory. You should have 3 `.html` files and a `.txt`
file with matching timestamps. A summary of the different reports are included
in the table below. For a detailed description of each report see the Nextflow
documentation on [reports](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html).

| Report type | Description                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dag`       | A high-level graph that shows how processes and channels are connected to each other. |
| `report`    | A visual summary of the time and resources used grouped by process.                   |
| `timeline`  | A Gannt chart that shows when each task started and ended.                            |
| `trace`     | A detailed text log with the time and resources used by each task.                    |

Complete the following steps in the exercise to view the report file `report-*.html` in your local browser.  

!!! question "Exercise"

    1. In the VSCode file explorer sidebar, locate the report file (e.g. `report-*.html`)
    2. Right click on the file and select **"Download"** to save it to your local computer.
    3. Open the `report-*.html` in a browser.
    4. Navigate to **"Resource Usage" -> "CPU"**.
    5. Hover over the `FASTQC` bar chart and note the `mean` CPU usage.

    !!! quote "Poll"

        What was the `mean` CPU usage for your `FASTQC` process?

    ??? note "Solution"

        In this report, a mean of 2.53 CPUs were utilised by the `FASTQC` process
        across the 3 samples. This value will slightly differ across runs.
